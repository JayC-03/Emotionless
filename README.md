PCPS2
=====

PCSX2 is dead. Its code is a pile of unreadable ruins, its management
unwilling to change. Its hacks and bugs are enough to make a grown man weep.
A new emulator must attempt to dethrone PCSX2. Hopefully, that emulator will
be PCPS2, a PS2 emulator architected after modern Dolphin.

Goals
=====

- Clean code
- As small an amount of hacks and kludges as possible
- Accuracy as long it is still playable on modern computers.
